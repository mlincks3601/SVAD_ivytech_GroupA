Scenario 1: Employee with No Dependents
Name: Jessica Parker
Hourly Rate: $20.00
Hours Worked: 40

How the program works for Jessica:
It asks for her ID, name, hourly rate, and hours worked.

Her gross pay is calculated:
20.00 * 40 = $800.00

Taxes are taken out (13.5% total):
$800 * 0.135 = $108.00

Her net pay (what she actually gets to take home):
$800 - $108 = $692.00

Code Summary: 
Employee ID: 1
Employee Name: Jessica Parker
Gross Pay: $800.00
Tax Deduction: $108.00
Net Pay: $692.00

Scenario 2: Employee with 1 Dependent
Name: Maddie Lincks
Hourly Rate: $22.00
Hours Worked: 35

What's different?
We’ll say having 1 dependent gives her a small tax break, maybe 1% off total tax.

Gross pay:
22.00 * 35 = $770.00

Taxes with 12.5% instead of 13.5%:
770 * 0.125 = $96.25

Net pay:
770 - 96.25 = $673.75

Code Output:
Employee ID: 2
Employee Name: Maddie Lincks
Gross Pay: $770.00
Tax Deduction: $96.25
Net Pay: $673.75

Scenario 3: Employee with 3 Dependents
Name: Jessie Jones
Hourly Rate: $25.00
Hours Worked: 45

What's different?
With 3 dependents, let’s say her tax rate drops more — let’s use 11% total tax.

Gross pay:
25.00 * 45 = $1,125.00

Taxes at 11%:
1,125 * 0.11 = $123.75

Net pay:
1,125 - 123.75 = $1,001.25

Code Output:
Employee ID: 3
Employee Name: Jessie Jones
Gross Pay: $1,125.00
Tax Deduction: $123.75
Net Pay: $1,001.25
